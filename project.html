    <b>Online Bookstore</b></p>
  <p>
The main objective of the project is to create an online book store that allows users
to search and purchase a book online based on title, author and subject. The
selected books are displayed in a tabular format and the user can order their books
    online through credit card payment.</p>
  <p>
    Online Book store is an online web application where the customer can purchase
books online. Through a web browser the customers can search for a book by its
title or author, later can add to the shopping cart and finally purchase using credit
card transaction. The user can login using his account details or new customers can
set up an account very quickly. They should give the details of their name, contact
number and shipping address. The user can also give feedback to a book by giving
ratings on a score of five. The books are divided into many categories based on
    subject like Software, Database, English, Architecture etc. </p>
  <p>
    The Online Book Store Website provides customers with online shopping through a
web browser. A customer can, create, sign in to his account, place items into a
shopping cart and purchase using his credit card details.
The Administrator will have additional functionalities when compared to the
common user. He can add, delete and update the book details, book categories,
member information and also confirm a placed order. </p>
